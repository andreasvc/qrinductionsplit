\section{Introduction}

\section{Literature Review}
In this section we will review a few of the papers that have contributed
greatly to the definition of Qualitative Reasoning. We will give a short
summary of the papers and will conclude with an overview of the current field
of research and possible future work.

\subsection{Qualitative Reasoning}
The following papers describe the foundations of qualitative reasoning.

\subsubsection{A qualitative Physics based on confluences (de Kleer \& Brown)}

\subsubsection{Qualitative Process Theory (Forbus)}

\subsubsection{Garp3 - Workbench for Qualitative Modelling and Simulation (Bredeweg et al.)}

\subsection{Automated Modeling}

To introduce the recent developments in the field of automated modelling we
will now review a few papers on this topic.

\subsubsection{Hylke}
Cluster, Superclusters, Causal paths.

\subsubsection{Jochem}
%less brute force, instead attempt to find the conceptually correct model immediately

\subsubsection{Carsten}
Causal groups % feedback loops, interacting processes

\subsection{Overview}
%overview of what?

\section{Theory}

In the field of QR, models %( / scenario's / systems ?) 
consist of
several smaller fragments which can be roughly divided in three categories:
static, process and agent. This categorization is not strict, but gives
a certain view on how things work. Static fragments are used to describe the
structure of a model, as well as proportionalities between quantities. A static
fragment cannot have any agents or influences in it. A \emph{process} fragment
should have at least one direct influence and is not restricted in terms of dependencies. %(relations?)
Finally, \emph{agent} fragments should be used to describe any influences on a
system that are external, hence not part of the system itself.

Fragments can be useful to make the complete system more comprehensible -- ie., they are a form of chunking. 
Also, while building these complex models, fragments allow the user to focus on
what happens in a small part of the model, without having to worry about the
other 'components'. For example in a model describing a population, seperate
fragments could describe processes like birth, death, emigration, etc.

Recent work on automated modeling \cite{buisman, vanweelden, liem} has focused
on generating a correct model based on a full-envisionment behavior graph. The
current algorithms always produce a single model fragment which describes the
complete system. The useful fragmentation of a system is hereby lost and
comprehending the output could become quite difficult with large models. We
therefore introduce a way of splitting such a single monolithic model into
smaller fragments while preserving the exact same behavior.

\section{Approach}
In this section we describe our approach on inducing model fragments.

\subsection{Monolithic model}

We take a monolithic model and divide it into several smaller fragments. To do
so, we need to comply to several requirements:

\begin{itemize}
\item all dependencies have to be retained

\item the behavior has to be reproducable

\item 

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Algorithm}

\begin{itemize}

\item Find a list of pivots, conditions on which the model fragments are based.
Currently these are single structural relations.

\item For each pivot, find a set of dependencies which apply whenever the pivot
is present, without exception

\item Generalize these dependencies into a single model fragment, several
dependencies among instances may be compressed into one

\end{itemize}

\section{Experiments \& Results}

%single population? split into birth, migration etc.
%interacting populations? but ants garden is too much

% World domination etc.

Notes

    * For the stacked bath tub model we changed the quantity-space of flow to ZPM (instead of ZP) because then we could replace the value-correspondences by a single Q-correspondence..
    * To be able to intergrate the splitting into the AM we need full scenario because we need all information about entities and quantities (we've entered them by hand for now..)

Ideas

    * done: split code for model output into generation & garp adding
    * current: compositional model fragments (also: accept existing model fragments as input)
    * deferred: lift full envisionment requirement, accept negative input (eg. list of impossible value combinations).
    * deferred: user interaction: graphical dialog to choose best model in case of ambiguity

----------------------------------------------
Todos

    * done: fix influences
    * done: fix output of models to garp. deferred: each possible model should become a model fragment (too much ambiguity)
    * done: split into multiple model fragments: working code: qrsplit
    * done: collapse similar model fragments into generic model fragments (eg. Faucet1 =>I+ Bath1 and Faucet2 => I+ Bath2 becomes Faucet =>I+ Bath)
    * done: detect necessary structural relations / other conditions required to make a model fragment generic.
    * distinguish between static (no influences) & process; filter current list of fragments and split them in a static and a process list.
    * integrate code with model induction (input) & garp (output)
    * try other models listed in van Weelden & Buisman. notably, communicating vessels

    * report: Intro - Summary per paper (literature review) - Discussion - Conclusion - Project - Theoretical / Practical / Technical Perspectives * further details: blackboard

Minutes
April 13th 2010

New plan:

    * Some sort of standard for what a well-formed fragment should be
    * -- Static vs process fragments?
    * -- Everything per entity 1 fragment?
    * -- Things like 'birth', 'death', 'emigration' and 'immigration'?
    * -- Influences?

    * We need some sort of evaluation to check our models against.

    * First run a the models we want to use and analyze their current output, compare them to our 'ideal' output.
    * We should not worry about intergration with the current Automatic Modeling code for now. First focus on hand-corrected input.
    * Recognizing duplicate (super)cluster could be a nice step to start with.. to get working on the code.

Notes:

    * Influences: now written to screen --> should be asserted
    * I's wrong direction? (inf-pos-a-b = b --> a)
    * naive dependencies: exponential
    * Communicating vessels: hack in causal groups: same entities (same_object_group/2)
    * Choose hacks for conceptually best model

    * Discussed with Floris that finding correspondences could be done faster by first looking for them without considering naive_dependencies yet.
